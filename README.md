# Queen Epoch - Masters Chess Games from 1985 to 1989

The charismatic Jewish-Armenian outsider, Garry Kasparov, fought FIDE
and the Soviet authorities, he took the World Champion title and
dominated chess for the next fifteen years.

This epoch covers Kasparov's victory over Karpov in 1985, to his first
public match against a supercomputer, Deep Thought, in 1989, and this
time, still won by the human.

The 1989 split was also because this was the limit on how many chess games
fit on a CD-ROM.

These were taken from public domain sources and have been sitting on a
hard drive for a decade or two (or three in some cases).

There may be duplicates, mistakes, transcription errors and missing fields.

Contributions and corrections are very welcome. More games from the
period too, as we no longer have to care about fitting on a CD-ROM.
